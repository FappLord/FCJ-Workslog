# Summary Report: “AWS re:Invent 2025 Recap (Vietnam)”

### Event Details
| | |
|:---|:---|
| **Date & Time** | January 27, 2026 |
| **Location** | AWS Vietnam Office (Floor 26 & 36), Ho Chi Minh City |
| **Role** | Attendee (FCJ Cloud Intern) |

### Event Objectives

- Update on the most critical announcements from AWS re:Invent 2025 (Las Vegas).
- Deep dive into Generative AI, specifically Agentic AI and Amazon Bedrock.
- Explore new data storage and infrastructure optimizations (SageMaker, S3).
- Network with AWS Solution Architects and the local tech community.

### Speakers

- **Mr. Thi** – Solution Architect (Topic: Generative AI & Agents)
- **Mr. Tung** – Speaker (Topic: OpenSearch & Agentic Search)
- **Various AWS Solution Architects & Account Managers**

### Key Highlights

#### Session 1: Generative AI & Agents

- **Amazon Nova Models:** Introduction to the new high-performance foundation models.
- **Bedrock Agents:** Deep dive into Orchestration, Flows, and the new **Memory** and **Guardrails** capabilities.
- **Agentic AI:** Moving from simple chatbots to autonomous agents that can execute multi-step workflows.

#### Session 2: SageMaker Unified Studio & S3 Updates

- **Unified Studio:** A single IDE bringing Data Engineers, Data Scientists, and AI Engineers together, breaking down silos.
- **S3 Tables:** Native support for the Apache Iceberg table format within S3.
- **S3 Vector:** A new feature enabling native vector storage in S3, offering significant cost reduction compared to dedicated vector databases.

#### Session 3 & 4: Search & Multimodal AI

- **OpenSearch Serverless:** Integration with MCP (Model Context Protocol) and Agentic Memory.
- **Nova Multimodal Embeddings:** Converting video and images into vectors for search.
- **Bedrock Data Automation:** Automated extraction of insights from multimedia content.

#### Session 5: AI Infrastructure

- **SageMaker HyperPod:** Advanced management for large-scale GPU clusters.
- **SageMaker MLflow:** Full lifecycle management for Machine Learning projects.

### Key Takeaways

#### The Future is Agentic

- **Autonomous Workflows:** The shift is happening from "Prompt Engineering" to "Agent Engineering." Agents with memory can maintain context over time and perform complex tasks without constant human intervention.
- **Guardrails are essential:** As agents become autonomous, strict policy and security guardrails are required to ensure safe operations.

#### Data & Compute Optimization

- **Cost Efficiency:** **S3 Vector** is a game-changer for projects requiring vector search (like RAG) but operating on a budget. It eliminates the need for expensive, dedicated vector DBs for many use cases.
- **Collaboration:** **SageMaker Unified Studio** streamlines the workflow, allowing data preparation and model training to happen in one environment.

### Applying to Work

- **Project Integration (Security Platform):**
    - Evaluate **Bedrock Agents** to automate the "vulnerability scanning" workflow (e.g., an agent that runs a scan, analyzes the log, and drafts a report).
    - Implement **S3 Vector** to store logs and vulnerability signatures efficiently for the project's backend.
- **Architecture Refinement:** Consider adopting **Cognito** for user management based on discussions with SAs.
- **Best Practices:** Apply the "Serverless first" mindset learned from the networking sessions to keep the project infrastructure lean.

### Event Experience

Attending the **“AWS re:Invent 2025 Recap”** at the **AWS Vietnam Office** was a pivotal moment in my internship.

#### Gaining Vision
- The sessions clarified that **Agentic AI** is the immediate future. Seeing the demo of a Flow Agent analyzing sales data inspired ideas for our own project's reporting features.
- Understanding **Multimodal RAG** opened my eyes to possibilities beyond just text processing—essential for future phases of our Security Platform where screenshot analysis might be needed.

#### Technical Validation
- The introduction of **S3 Vector** validated our team's need for a cost-effective storage solution. It was a direct answer to a problem we were facing regarding log analysis costs.
- Networking with Mr. Thi and other SAs helped clarify doubts about **IAM Policies** and **Serverless** best practices that I struggled with in Week 3.

#### Community & Networking
- The atmosphere at the AWS Office (Floor 26 & 36) was energetic, with builders and developers sharing real-world challenges.
- I had the opportunity to discuss the **"TheBois" team project** with industry experts and received valuable feedback on our proposed architecture.

> Overall, this event not only updated my technical knowledge but also provided concrete tools (Agents, S3 Vector) that I can immediately apply to the **Website Security Baseline Assessment Platform**.
